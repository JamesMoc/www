        <p class="bodyText">Validators are the backbone of decentralized consensus in the RCHain's proof-of-stake network. Validators have the chance to earn rewards and contribute to the network's security and performance.</p>
        <p class="bodyText">As we work to the launch of the RChain blockchain in Q2 of 2019, we are also working toward answering many of the questions potential validators have. Please see the FAQ for what we know today. This page and this FAQ will be updated frequently as more information becomes available.</p>
